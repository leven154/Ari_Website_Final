    <p class="project-description">This piece presents a visual timeline of a typical day in my life, charting everything from waking up to winding down. The second image shows the initial phase of the project, where I created a graph tracking my daily routines. Through this process, I discovered that much of my day was spent on my phone or computer, working, which inspired the creation of the final piece. The finished work reflects how deeply embedded technology is in my daily life, seamlessly integrating with my other routines throughout the day.</p>

    <p class="project-description">This self-portrait captures the chaos and creativity not only of my workspace but also of how I spend most of my time as a student and designer. I began the project by creating a timeline sketch of my typical workday, starting with the bus ride as I watch the town pass by. I then chose to focus on what happens after I get off the bus—settling down with a latte in a bustling environment and diving into the grind. This setting helps me stay focused, sometimes for hours at a time.</p>

    <p class="project-description">Short Film (Video Editing, Sound Design, Found Footage)</p>
    <p class="project-description">This piece is a personal interpretation of Maya Angelou’s poem A Brave and Startling Truth. I aimed to capture the rawness and authenticity of the world around us, especially when we're not consumed by technology, work, or school. I began by taking photos from the past year and collaging them together, accompanied by the song 'Film' by Aphex Twin, to evoke a sense of nostalgia for a world that is rapidly disappearing. I then created a second version using videos I had captured over the past few months, concluding the short film with a clip from Lake Harriet Band Shell, one of my favorite places to reflect on life.</p>

    <p class="project-description">Physical Paper Model with AI-Enhanced Photography</p>
    <p class="project-description">I created a three-dimensional paper model of my bedroom using origami techniques, then scanned the paper version and used artificial intelligence to add background features to the room. Through this process, I wanted to explore how AI is gradually integrating into my life as a designer, blurring the line between real life and AI. I began the project by constructing a pillow fort in my bedroom to highlight the innocence of design and its everyday simplicity. As I progressed, the piece evolved into a more advanced rendition when I realized how frequently I rely on AI to assist with many of my projects.</p>

    <p class="project-description">Collage Pastel Drawing</p>
    <p class="project-description">
      This piece captures a moment of motion and self-expression through skateboarding. I began skating during my freshman year of high school, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. I never expected the hobby to stick—but here I am, in my sophomore year of college, still skating. Admittedly, I’m still not great at it, but I’ve kept going despite countless failed attempts at kickflips and reverts. With this project, I wanted to highlight my dedication to myself—how sometimes we keep pushing forward without even realizing it, simply because there's something satisfying about failing and trying again.

  <article class="project">
    <h2 class="project-title">Reflection</h2>
    <p class="project-description">Looking back on these projects, I realize how much of my work is rooted in everyday life. My routines, memories, frustrations, and the ways I process the world around me. Whether it’s building a paper model of my bedroom or documenting my failed skate tricks, each piece is a reflection of where I’ve been emotionally, creatively, and personally. I’ve always been interested in blending the analog with the digital—cutting paper by hand, using AI to fill in the gaps, collaging photos with sound—because that’s how my brain works: a mix of structure and chaos, memory and imagination.
      A lot of my work explores how technology has become part of my day-to-day life, sometimes without me even noticing. At the same time, I’m drawn to moments of stillness and nostalgia, things like watching the world go by on a bus or sitting at Lake Harriet just thinking. I’m not always trying to make something polished or perfect. Most of the time, I’m trying to make something honest. I want my work to feel like something real people can relate to—because I’m still figuring things out, and I think there’s beauty in that.
      Through all of these projects, I’ve learned that I’m someone who keeps showing up—for myself, for the process—even when things aren’t working out exactly how I planned. Whether it’s failed kickflips, AI glitches, or weird little timeline graphs, every piece is part of a larger story I’m telling about growth, creativity, and not being afraid to just try.
